## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies 
$ npm install
$ npm install --global gulp-cli

# Build project
$ gulp
```
Open page with desired render, e.g. localhost:9100/dist/renders/image/index.html
## Demo
https://dev-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/dc-demo-site/dist/homepage/index.html?c=d8b929ee-214d-48f0-90c0-4e121ca55a6f&s=e6bdb253-db3c-4458-b5cc-0d90aa02e114
## Content Packages
Commonly used content type templates have been split up into separate packages.
Individual packages can be found in `src/renders`, here you can edit any render templates or styling prior to running a build. Note that the actual content types are stored in a different repository, which can be found here:

https://github.com/amplience/dc-accelerators-content-types

## Setting up the Content Types

Before registering the content types, they need to be hosted at an http location. The standard content types are by default stored at https://dev-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/DynamicContentTypes/Accelerators, but this can be changed in the `.replace.json` file.

When the content types have been placed at a basepath URL and the project built with the same basepath, you can start the process of registering the content types in Dynamic Content:

- Log in to the Amplience Dynamic Content platform and navigate to the development tab.
- Click on the button "Register content type".
- Add the content type URL and the content type label. It's important that the URL is the same as the URL where the content type is hosted. You can also add icons, cards, visualisations and associated repositories if needed.
- Add a content type icon. You can either choose one from Amplience or enter the URL where your own icon is located. The URLs for the icons can be found below.
- Add a content type card. You can either choose one from Amplience or enter the URL where your own card is located. The URLs for the cards can be found below.
- Choose associated repositories for the content types. Content types should not be associated with slot repositories.
- Add a visualisation. The visualisation files for each specific render can be found in their respective folders in `src/renders`. The visualisation files need to be hosted at an http location as well. When that has been done you need to add the URL for the visualisation followed by the parameters "vse" and "content", i.e. 

	```?vse={{vse.domain}}&content={{content.sys.id}}```

	For example, if the basepath for the visualisation is 

	```https://dev-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/dc-renders/dist/renders/image/package/visualisation.html```

	then the URL for the visualisation would be

	```https://dev-solutions.s3.amazonaws.com/dc-renders/dist/renders/image/package/visualisation.html?vse={{vse.domain}}&content={{content.sys.id}}```

	You also need to add a label for the visualisation.

- Click save.
- Repeat this process for all the content types needed for your render (dependencies are listed below).
- Navigate to the production tab and select "Create content".
- Select the content type you wish to use for your content, fill out the content form and click save.
- Enter the name of the content and which folder to save it in and click save.
- Navigate back to the production tab. You can now view the content GUID. By clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the content you can, among other things, view the content or select the content ID.

## Setting up the Transformation Templates

To display image content correctly with roundels, the handlebars template makes use of a transformation template. This needs to be set up within your Amplience account before the renders will work properly.

- Log in to Amplience OnDemand and open up the "tools" menu.
- Select the "Transformation Templates" option in the menu.
- Click the "new" button in the top right of the screen.
- Set both the "Friendly Name" and "Template Name" to be "roundel".
- In the "Additional Parameters" box, enter these parameters:

```
myasset=empty&p1_img=empty&p2_img=empty&p3_img=empty&p4_img=empty&qlt=90&roundelRatio=1&layer0=[src=/i//{$prod_img}&w=1350]&layer1=[src=/i//{$p1_img}&w={376*$roundelRatio}&right=10&bottom=10&anchor=BR&visible={$p1_img!=$myasset}&img404=roundel_fallback]&layer2=[src=/i//{$p2_img}&w={376*$roundelRatio}&left=10&bottom=10&anchor=BL&visible={$p2_img!=$myasset}]&layer3=[src=/i//{$p3_img}&w={376*$roundelRatio}&left=10&top=10&anchor=TL&visible={$p3_img!=$myasset}]&layer4=[src=/i//{$p4_img}&w={376*$roundelRatio}&right=10&top=10&anchor=TR&visible={$p4_img!=$myasset}]  
```

- Click "Create".

To add a point of interest transformation template, follow the same instructions with "Friendly Name" and "Template Name" set to poi, and with these parameters in the "Additional Parameters" box:

```
scaleFit=poi&poi={$this.metadata.pointOfInterest.x},{$this.metadata.pointOfInterest.y},{$this.metadata.pointOfInterest.w},{$this.metadata.pointOfInterest.h}
```

To add a template with layers, you will also need to add an empty image to the account. The empty image can be found in the repository.

## Generated Builds
Built renders are located in `dist/renders` folder.
Here you can find unminified and minified css, handlebars templates and the visualisation html page.
The `libs` folder contains JS dependencies for the render. Most of the files in the `libs` folder are taken from the `dist/reusable` folder, described below.
## Dependencies
All JS dependencies for renders can be found in the `dist/reusable` folder.
JS dependencies are composed of helper scripts and 3d party libs.
### Helper Scripts
Helper scripts can also be found in `src/reusable/js` folder. Below is the list of scripts and their description:

- `utils.js` is needed to make AJAX requests to retrieve render data. It also has several methods to troubleshoot the renders.
- `hanldebars_helpers.js` is used to declare various handlebars helpers, to solve different tasks for handlebars templates.

### 3rd-party Libs
All 3d-party libs are pulled as npm dependencies and can be found in package.json

- `handlebars.min.js` is the handlebars templates library.
- `cms-javascript-sdk.min.js` is used to format the requested JSON content. Example usage: 

```javascript
amp.inlineContent(JSON.parse(data));
```
- `showdown.min.js` is used to parse text with markdown and convert it into semantic html.
- `lory.min.js` is a slider library and is used for slider renders.

## Building Minified and Concatenated Files
```bash
# Install dependencies 
$ npm install
$ npm install --global gulp-cli

# Build minified project
$ gulp buildAllMin
```
This will build minified and concatenated files for all renders.
